Task ID: email-flow-restructure
Agent: main
Task: Restructure the email flow + orchestrator per user's 5 requirements (without deploying):
  1. Add a "test" audience with 3 emails (eze@massapro.com, ezeszna@gmail.com, eze@hi4.ai)
  2. Delete all demo data from the orchestrator; show only real + test data
  3. Add email template + A/B subject testing to the flow, with per-content/subject reporting
  4. Restructure flow: A) audience → B) trigger → C) email, repeatable up to 8 steps
  5. Fill campaign report with breakdown by template + subject variant, all metrics

Work Log:
- Reviewed full email orchestration architecture: flow-builder-canvas, orchestrator-panel,
  Prisma schema (EmailFlow, EmailFlowStep, EmailQueue, EmailStageTemplate, EmailCampaign),
  flow-worker, flow-trigger, seed.ts, API routes.
- Asked 5 clarifying questions; user chose: per-step entry-event triggers, reusable audience
  entity, 50/50 random A/B split, flow runs report, wipe + rebuild migration.
- Phase 1 — Prisma schema changes:
  * Added EmailAudience model (id, name, slug, emailsJson, isTest, timestamps)
  * Restructured EmailFlowStep: added audienceId, triggerKind, triggerEventId,
    subjectVariantA, subjectVariantB; removed subjectOverride, branchRulesJson, filterJson
  * Removed flow-level triggerKind, triggerEventId, branchEvaluationDelayHours from EmailFlow
  * Removed EmailFlowRun model entirely (steps are independent now)
  * Added subjectVariant + audienceId to EmailQueue for A/B reporting
  * Removed flowRunId from EmailQueue; added flowStep relation to EmailQueue
  * Cleaned up back-relations on User, EventRsvp, Event
  * Bumped max steps from 5 to 8
- Phase 2 — Created migration SQL at prisma/migrations/20260705000000_email_flow_restructure/migration.sql
- Phase 3 — Rewrote seed.ts:
  * Removed demo users/event/RSVPs seeding (was 6 mock users + 1 demo event + 6 RSVPs)
  * Now only seeds 5 stage templates + the built-in Test audience (3 emails)
  * clearSeed() now wipes flow data but preserves real users/events/RSVPs + Test audience
- Phase 4 — Updated email-flows API routes (POST/PATCH/GET/[id]) for new step shape
- Phase 5 — Created EmailAudience CRUD API (GET/POST /api/email-audiences, PATCH/DELETE /[id])
- Phase 6 — Rewrote flow-builder-canvas.tsx:
  * New step card showing A (audience), B (trigger), C (email + A/B subjects), D (delay)
  * Step editor sheet with 4 sections matching the A/B/C/D structure
  * "Auto-create variant B" button for A/B subject testing
  * Up to 8 steps (was 5)
- Phase 7 — Rewrote flow-trigger.ts:
  * Per-step entry-event triggers with audience matching
  * 50/50 random A/B subject assignment at queue creation time
  * New manuallyTriggerStepForAudience() for "send to test audience" action
  * Wired RSVP_GOING trigger into /api/events/[slug]/rsvp POST route
- Phase 8 — Rewrote flow-worker.ts:
  * Simplified to send due PENDING EmailQueue rows (no linear run state machine)
  * No branching, no EmailFlowRun — each queue row is an independent send
  * Picks subject based on row.subjectVariant (A or B)
- Phase 9 — Created flow report:
  * New /api/email-flows/[id]/report endpoint with per-step → variant A/B breakdown
  * New FlowReportDialog component with summary cards + per-step table + recent sends
  * Shows sent, opened, clicked, failed, pending, open rate, click rate per variant
- Phase 10 — Updated orchestrator-panel.tsx:
  * "Seed demo data" → "Seed templates + Test audience"
  * "Clear demo data" → "Clear flow data"
  * Added Variant column to queue table (shows A/B pill)
  * Added subject variant + audience to detail dialog
  * Updated worker toast to show combined legacy + flow stats
  * Updated empty-state message to point to Flow Builder
- Phase 11 — Updated flows/page.tsx:
  * Auto-seeds test audience + templates on page load (idempotent)
  * Loads audiences from DB + passes to client
  * Fixed AppHeader prop + date serialization for events
- Phase 12 — TypeScript verification:
  * npx prisma generate succeeds
  * npx tsc --noEmit: 0 new errors from my changes
  * 3 pre-existing errors remain (simulate/route.ts, meta-capi.ts, worker.ts) — confirmed
    via git stash that they existed before
  * My changes fixed 4 pre-existing errors in old flow-worker.ts

Stage Summary:
- All 5 requirements implemented without deploying (code + migration only)
- Test audience (eze@massapro.com, ezeszna@gmail.com, eze@hi4.ai) auto-seeded
- Demo data removed; clearSeed preserves real data + Test audience
- Flow restructured: A) audience → B) trigger → C) email (template + A/B subjects) → D) delay,
  up to 8 independent steps
- 50/50 random A/B subject split, stored on EmailQueue.subjectVariant
- Flow report dialog with per-step → template → subject variant A/B breakdown (sent, opened,
  clicked, failed, pending, open rate, click rate)
- Migration SQL ready at prisma/migrations/20260705000000_email_flow_restructure/migration.sql
- TO DEPLOY: run `npx prisma migrate deploy` (or `prisma db push` for dev), then the app
  auto-seeds the Test audience on first /admin/email/flows page load
